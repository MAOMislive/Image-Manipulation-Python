| [PNG_to_JPEG.py](https://github.com/MAOMislive/Image-Manipulation-Python/blob/main/PNG_to_JPEG.py) | An easy approach to convert the PNG images to JPEG file format. | **ChatGPT** & <br>**abhilb** from Stack Overflow ([Question link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58148723/how-to-convert-a-directory-of-image-on-png-to-jpg-in-python)) | Make sure to install the necessary files for PIL (for image manipulation). |
| [image_upscaling.py](https://github.com/MAOMislive/Image-Manipulation-Python/blob/main/image_upscaling.py) | An easy approach to Upscale any image. | **ChatGPT** | Make sure to install the necessary files for **cv2**(for image upscaling). |
| [batch_image_upscaling.py](https://github.com/MAOMislive/Image-Manipulation-Python/blob/main/batch_image_upscaling.py) | An easy approach to Upscale in batch. | **ChatGPT** | Make sure to install the necessary files for **cv2**(for image upscaling). |
| [upscaled_jpg_rename.py](https://github.com/MAOMislive/Image-Manipulation-Python/blob/main/upscaled_jpg_rename.py) | An easy approach to combine upscaling, converting to JPEG and renaming the file. | **ChatGPT** | Make sure to install the necessary files for **cv2**(for image upscaling). |
